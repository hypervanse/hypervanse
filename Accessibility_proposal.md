# üß† README ‚Äî Deque Enterprise Proposal (Hypervanse Edition)

This repository contains an interactive, Matrix-themed HTML proposal authored by **Frederico Correia Moreira** (aka **Hypervanse**), intended to initiate a strategic partnership with **Deque Systems**.

The proposal leverages findings discovered during a Pro trial of axe DevTools and highlights severe accessibility and metadata injection issues found in popular Semantic Web tools‚Äîincluding Google's Gemini and Microsoft's Semantic Kernel.
